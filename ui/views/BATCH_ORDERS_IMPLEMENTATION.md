# Batch Orders Implementation

## Overview

The "Orders (Batch)" screen has been successfully implemented as a new view in the Registrar Operations Center GUI. This screen provides a user interface for processing multiple orders in batch mode, following the same logic as the provided example code.

## Key Features

### 1. User Interface Components

- **Batch Size Input**: Allows users to specify how many orders to process (default: 1)
- **Control Buttons**: 
  - "Refresh Orders" - Updates the list of eligible orders
  - "Start Batch Processing" - Begins the batch processing
  - "Stop Processing" - Allows users to halt processing mid-batch
- **Progress Display**: Shows current processing status
- **Orders Table**: Displays all eligible orders (same filtered data as "Orders (Single)")
- **Output Log**: Real-time display of processing results and any errors

### 2. Batch Processing Logic

The implementation follows the exact pattern from the provided example code:

```python
total_count_limit = 1   # How many you want in batch (user-specified)
run = 0  # Counter for loop

while run < total_count_limit:
    try:
        next_possible_pending_order = verification.OrderVerification(config).get_next_pending_order()
        # Display order information
        result = verification.OrderVerification(config).generate_verification_email(next_possible_pending_order)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        break

    run += 1
    print(f'Processed {run} \n')
```

### 3. Threading Implementation

- Batch processing runs in a separate thread to prevent GUI freezing
- Real-time progress updates are displayed in the main thread
- Users can stop processing at any time
- Thread-safe communication between processing thread and GUI

### 4. Error Handling

- Validates batch size input (must be positive integer)
- Catches and displays exceptions during processing
- Halts processing on any error (as specified in requirements)
- Provides detailed error messages in the output log

## File Structure

### New Files Created

- `ui/views/batch_orders.py` - The main BatchOrdersView class

### Modified Files

- `ui/app.py` - Updated to import and use BatchOrdersView for "Batch (Orders)" screen

## Class Structure

### BatchOrdersView

**Location**: `ui/views/batch_orders.py`

**Key Methods**:
- `__init__()` - Initializes the view with configuration and order verification
- `build_ui()` - Creates the user interface components
- `refresh()` - Updates the orders list display
- `start_batch_processing()` - Initiates batch processing in a separate thread
- `stop_batch_processing()` - Halts processing
- `process_batch(total_count_limit)` - Main processing loop
- `log_output(message)` - Adds messages to the output log
- `_update_output_text(message)` - Thread-safe text widget updates

**Key Attributes**:
- `batch_size_var` - Tkinter variable for batch size input
- `is_processing` - Boolean flag for processing state
- `orders_tree` - Treeview widget for displaying orders
- `output_text` - Text widget for processing output

## Usage

1. **Navigate to "Batch (Orders)"** in the navigation panel
2. **Set Batch Size** - Enter the number of orders to process
3. **Review Orders** - The table shows all eligible orders for processing
4. **Start Processing** - Click "Start Batch Processing" to begin
5. **Monitor Progress** - Watch the progress display and output log
6. **Stop if Needed** - Use "Stop Processing" to halt mid-batch

## Integration

The BatchOrdersView integrates seamlessly with the existing application:

- Uses the same `OrderVerification` class as other views
- Follows the same UI patterns and styling
- Refreshes automatically when the view is displayed
- Maintains consistency with the overall application design

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Class structure and method availability
- ✅ Import and instantiation capabilities
- ✅ Source code completeness
- ✅ Integration with the main application

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Process multiple orders without manual intervention
2. **Visibility**: Real-time progress tracking and detailed logging
3. **Control**: Ability to stop processing and specify batch size
4. **Consistency**: Same filtering logic as single order processing
5. **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling with detailed feedback

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Batch size presets (5, 10, 25, etc.)
- Processing statistics and summary reports
- Export of processing results
- Configuration for processing delays between orders
- Preview of orders before processing
